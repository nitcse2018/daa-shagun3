Byte Streams and Character Streams

A byte stream access the file byte by byte. 
Java programs use byte streams to perform input and output of 8-bit bytes. 
It is suitable for any kind of file, however not quite appropriate for text files. 
For example, if the file is using a unicode encoding and a character is represented with two bytes, 
the byte stream will treat these separately and you will need to do the conversion yourself. 
Byte oriented streams do not use any encoding scheme while Character oriented streams use character 
encoding scheme(UNICODE).
All byte stream classes are descended from InputStream and OutputStream .

A character stream will read a file character by character. 
Character Stream is a higher level concept than Byte Stream. 
A Character Stream is, effectively, a Byte Stream that has been wrapped with logic that allows 
it to output characters from a specific encoding . 
That means, a character stream needs to be given the file's encoding in order to work properly. 
Character stream can support all types of character sets ASCII, Unicode, UTF-8, UTF-16 etc. 
All character stream classes 
are descended from Reader and Writer .
